This is version 0.1.2 of cnbt, released under the GPLv3.

It uses libpng and zlib.

How to compile:
- On most standard UNIX-y systems, 'make' should suffice
    as long as you have a slightly modern version of g++.
- It should work without prodding on Cygwin or MinGW.
- With Visual Studio, I used the precompiled zlib / libpng
    from the GTK project:
        http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html
    Add the includes / libraries to VS, and it should compile
    properly. The project files are from VS2008.

To edit colors:
- Muck around in minecraft.cpp for block colors.
- To change the level of grey applied to the side of blocks in
      oblique, look at line 196 of render.cpp.
